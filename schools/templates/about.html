    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>I started sgschools.today because I felt that students of computer science (and computer engineering)
        should be exposed to geographic information and geographic information systems (GIS), and were not.
        I
        drew up the following list of concepts, software, frameworks and websites, which I felt were
        important
        to anyone interested in creating an app or website that has a map:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>longitude and latitude</li>
        <li>geographic information systems</li>
        <li>geolocation and reverse geolocation</li>
        <li>OpenStreetMap and other projects involving volunteered geographic information (<a
                href="https://icaci.org/files/documents/wom/16_IMY_WoM_en.pdf">VGI</a>)
        </li>
        <li>coordinate systems like WGS84 and OSGB36</li>
        <li>Django and Geodjango</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL and PostGIS</li>
        <li>Leaflet.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The best way to get students to tinker or experiment with geographic information is to get them
        working
        on a Critical Inquiry project, and so, I proposed a CI project with this topic for Semester 2 (2018/19
        Academic Year). Three students from the MSc (Information Systems) programme took up the
        challenge,
        and
        this site is the product of their 13-week effort.</p>
    <h3>Phase 1: Laying the Foundations</h3>
    <p> In this phase, the data model was developed, a basic map interface developed to show the location of
        kindergartens and primary schools in Singapore. The focus was not on a rich set of functionality, but
        rather, to get a foundational set of code which could be built upon by future groups of students taking
        the Critical Inquiry module. This objective has been nicely met. I asked each student to provide a
        write-up about themselves so that they could be highlighted in the "About" page. The following are their
        write-ups:
    </p>
    <p><b>Zhang “John” Junzhi</b> graduate from Peking University with a degree in chemistry, in 2017. He did
        very well
        in his undergraduate studies – well enough for Cambridge University to offer him a PhD scholarship, but
        he decided to take a little detour after graduating to dabble with information technology. John worked
        at a chemistry lab as an undergraduate, and realised that although he liked chemistry, and science in
        general, becoming a research may not be his thing. During his internship at Televic doing web
        development, John discovered that he likes programming. John is an avid computer gamer, and he plays
        World of Warcraft and Civilization. Coming from Shanghai, John is amazed at the humid weather in
        Singapore.</p>
    <p>John is responsible for data collection, backend development and part of the frontend development. For
        harvest the data, he used Google Geocoding API and get all the geographic information on schools and
        kindergartens. For the backend, he designed the model types, URL mapper, and views to support the
        frontend. For the frontend, he focussed mainly on the map function (init_map.js and
        map_function.js).</p>
    <p>
        <b>Ren “Jennifer” Jiawei</b> holds a bachelor’s degree in optoelectronic information science and
        engineering
        from Zhejiang University. After graduating in 2018, she enrolled in the MSc (Information Systems)
        programme at the Nanyang Technological University. Jennifer hails from Shaoxing, China. Besides coding,
        Jennifer also likes to challenge herself in other ways. She once climbed the Ijen and Bromo Volcanos in
        Indonesia during the night to see the beautiful blue flame of the sulphur mine, and so that she could
        watch the sunrise. Jennifer has a sense of adventure, and occasionally takes on challenges to enjoy a
        sense of accomplishment (moving from optoelectronics to information systems is evidence of this). Her
        next challenge is to get a diving license.</p>
    <p>
        Jennifer has been in Singapore for a year now, and she says she likes this vibrant city because the
        flowers and lush vegetation make her feel alive. She hopes to travel to neighbouring Southeast Asian
        countries in the next trip. After studying information systems, she has become interested in UX design.
        She feels that good UX design is to help people reach the information they need within a shorter time
        and few operations. For sgschools.today, Jennifer is primarily responsible for front-end development as
        well as UI and interaction design. She hopes that this page will really help those who have the query
        needs and hope that her design will make it easy for users to understand and quickly locate a primary
        school that best suits their needs.

        <b>Sun Pu “Larry”</b> graduated from Singapore Management University (SMU) with Bachelor of Accountancy
        in
        2011, and he worked in the area of public accounting from 2014 to 2018. He is Chartered Accountant of
        Singapore, Certified Public Accountant (US) and Certified Internal Auditor. His last fulltime position
        was Senior Associate in PricewaterhouseCoopers Singapore. He has strong interests in IT because of his
        engineering background. He received a Diploma in Electronics Computer and Communication Engineering from
        Nanyang Polytechnic before he attended SMU.
    </p>
    <p>
        Larry like to explore the “Capture the Flag” (CTF) test in his spare time, and he is working towards
        becoming an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). He chose the MSc (Information Systems) as
        he would like to pursue a career with cybersecurity and IT risk management.
    </p>
    <p>
        Larry is responsible for the implementation of the web application on Virtual Private Server (VPS), and
        subsequent maintenance of the application such as update of the application. He uses the uWSGI and Nginx
        to implement the project on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS of AWS. He is looking at the possibility of containerizing
        the application using Docker, and is currently assessing the capability and convenience of subsequent
        maintenance using Docker.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 2: Adding More Content</h3>
    <p> In this phase, the content was enriched by adding secondary schools, libraries, and also contact information
        and primary schools previous years registration results. OneMap API, OpenCage API and Query UI were used to
        implement search by address / postal code. Implemented caching, so that all the schools are stored in memory
        when the Django application is started. There were some changes to the UI too: navigation bar and search bar
        were
        added, and pages were made responsive. Another batch of students worked on the phase 2:
    </p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.natalyakosenko.com/" target="_blank">Natalya Kosenko</a></strong> graduated from
        Novosibirsk State University (Russia) with a degree in
        mathematics. She has been working in South East Asia since 2010. While working in Singapore, she developed
        strong
        interest in coding and made decision to change her career track from manager to developer. This is how she ended
        up
        taking the Master's program in NTU. In this project, Natalya was responsible for getting the data: she used
        Python Beautiful Soup library to pull the data from various sources and to upload that data to the database. She
        also took over the server deployment part from Larry.</p>

    <p>
        <strong><a href="https://about.me/wujinzhou" target="_blank">Wu Jinzhou</a></strong> graguated from National
        University of Singapore in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Jinzhou has worked as a
        Software Engineer in a leading fabless simiconductor company from 2014 to 2017. During that time, he was
        responsible for the company's IoT chipset SDK's research and development. In 2018, Jinzhou developed his career
        by joining a top-notch technology company in AI, Blockchain & Cryptocurrency industry. He is now a Blockchain,
        Mining Pool & Cryptocurrency Developer in one of the world's largest Distributed Cryptocurrency Mining Pool.</p>
    <p>
        Jinzhou likes technology and is interested in SEO. He owns a YouTube channel which once listed in the top 100
        sites in South East Asia Region in terms of Monthly Visits.</p>
    <p>
        In this project, Jinzhou was responsible for the RESTful API integration and map function's upgrading. The
        integrated OneMap and OpenCage APIs which allow the map application to translate GPS geocodes to Singapore's
        postal address and extend the school search to any place in Singapore. The upgraded map functions implement
        several in-memory cache blocks which boost db access speed and enable the application to trace and reuse certain
        UI elements and hence create many new interactive features for users.
